# Predicting Prices of Houses in King County, USA
As a data analyst, I collected data of house prices in King County, USA.
Following data wrangling and EDA, I created a linear regression model with
parameters like total floors in the house, view to a waterfront, basement
square footage, number of bathrooms, etc. The model was evaluated using
ridge regression and refined by preforming a second order polynomial
transform on the training and testing data sets.
